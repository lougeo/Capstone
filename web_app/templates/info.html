            Modeling Decisions
        </h2><br>
        <p>
            I chose to run the targets against two different models: <br>
             - A Logistic Regression Model <br>
             - A Gradient Boosting Model <br>
            I chose to use these two models because they are relatively interpretable. The reason I chose to look at two models rather than simply the one with the best accuracy is because I am more interested in interpretability, and I think that it's interesting to compare the decisions made by the two models. <br> <br>

            Interpretability is important in the context of this project because I was never expecting to get great accuracy. This was expected due to (amoung other things): <br>
             - A plethora of confounding factors (Directors, Producers, Actors/Actresses, etc..). <br>
             - Several unresolvable, and major sources of bias, such as Survivorship Bias (only scripts which were made into movies where used to train the models). <br>
             - Unique to realm of scripts: Versioning (rewriting, editing, etc..). Ultimately the script (could be version 2) in my data set could be wildly different from the final version(could be version 10). <br>
            Due to these limitations, and with the models only predicting marginally better than random, the fruit of this project takes the form of funny, and hopefully intriguing insights into how Natural Language Processing works. <br> <br>

            My goal with regards to this project was around the process, improving my coding, and to better understand the tools at my disposal for use in future projects. <br> <br>

            I'd like to give a big thank you to the educators at <a href="https://brainstation.io/">BrainStation</a> for their continued help over the past couple of months, this is really a project I wouldn't have even been able to think about building before my time there. <br>
            I would also like to thank <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g">Corey Schafer</a> for some excellent coding tutorials, in particular his Flask series, from which this styling is copypasta, and the rest heavily influenced. <br><br>
